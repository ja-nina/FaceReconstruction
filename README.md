# FaceReconstruction :no_mouth:

Inpainting project done on https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ffhq with custom inpainting. ( right now done on 128x128 - for testing purposes, find the thumbnails on: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tg-Ur7d4vk1T8Bn0pPpUSQPxlPGBlGfv)

## Progress documentation:


**9.01.2023 Task 1:** :white_check_mark:

- try basc inpainting model (true model will be developed later in time) 
- download u≈Çomny dataset 128x128


**11.01.2023 Task 2:** 

- Construct basic architecture for experiment ( for example model type + optimizer)
- Do overfitting experiment (architecture)
- Discuss and research possible models + look into using a pretrained one
- discuss git for large data...


**11.01.2023 Task 3:** 
- Masking specific parts of face architecture (using pretrained object detector, objects being parts of face)
- See if masking specific face parts (mouth , eyes nose etc) makes sense
